    <h4>Overview of blood bank</h4>
    Blood Bank System Importance:
    A Blood Bank is essential for managing blood donations, storage, and distribution efficiently, ensuring quick response during emergencies.
    
   <h4>Project Focus</h4>
   Developing a robust, user-friendly system for blood banks to facilitate better access, tracking, and management of blood  resources. The project utilizes Pythonâ€™s library Tkinter (Tk=Tool kit; inter=interface) 
   to create GUI (Graphical User Interface). GUI helps to create a display interface  in windows which is being used to take input from users and displaying output. Inserting and accessing data is happening with 
   the  help of backend through SQLite3 connection.
   
   <h4>Establishing the Core Issues in existing systems</h4>
  <ul >
  <li>Unreliable Blood Stock Management</li>
  Outdated systems fail to provide real-time updates, leading to overstocking or shortages. Inefficient communication between hospitals and blood banks delays responses. Unpredictable events cause sudden demand     surges, overwhelming systems. Poor forecasting results in mismatched supply-demand dynamics and wastage. 
 
  <br><li>Inconsistent Access Across Regions</li>
  Remote areas lack proper blood banks and storage infrastructure. Urban centers have better access, creating healthcare disparities. Fewer donation drives in rural areas reduce available supply.
  </ul>

  <h4>Existing Systems</h4>
  <ul >
  <li>Manual Blood Bank Management</li>
  Manual blood bank management faces challenges like human errors, inefficiency, delays, and difficulty tracking inventory. It lacks real-time updates, has data inaccuracies, and is unsuitable for large-scale       operations.

  <br><li>Modern Web-Based Applications</li>
   Examples 
  <ol>
  <li>e-RaktKosh (India)</li>
  e-RaktKosh (India) is a centralized system by the Indian government offering real-time blood stock updates and streamlined data management across blood banks.

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>

  Blood bank database is a python application which helps people in the better way. The main objective of the blood bank  database is to manage the details of the donor, blood group, location of donor and the 
  details of the receiver. The  project is totally built at administrative end, makes it accessible to everyone and is also user friendly. The purpose of this  project is to built an application program to avoid 
  the death of people due to lack of blood. This application also allows  the users to add the details of them for donating blood. This project also helps in managing the received blood so that  there will be no 
  negative effect to the blood receiver once they received blood.
